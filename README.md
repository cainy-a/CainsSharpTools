# CainsSharpTools
A library of useful .NET tools, written in C#. Works on .NET Core and Framework/Mono.

Includes lots of cool stuff, including:
- Checking for Primes
- Checking for *lots of* Primes, from a List or Array
- Calculating Area and Volume
(Actually that's all of it, but we're only on the first version so don't judge me too hard)
